The Library Book Management System is a simple Python console-based application designed to help manage books in a small library or personal collection. The system allows users to perform basic library operations without requiring any external database or advanced modules.

This project uses Python lists and dictionaries to store book information, making it easy to understand for beginners. Users can add new books, view all books, issue books to borrowers, and return previously issued books. Each book is automatically assigned a unique ID and contains details such as title, author, and availability status.

The program runs continuously in a loop until the user chooses to exit, providing a user-friendly text-based menu for easy navigation. This project is ideal for beginners who want to practice Python programming concepts like functions, loops, conditional statements, and data structures.
